    "text": "Hi there! Professionally, I am a computational biologist with a focus on gene expression, and the goal of making a positive contribution to society. My background includes both computational and experimental biology, and work in fundamental research, clinical research, and industry. Outside of work, I enjoy arts (among which playing music and dancing), crafts (particularly woodworking and cooking), and spending time exploring. I care about the environment, human rights, education, and participating in like-minded communities."
