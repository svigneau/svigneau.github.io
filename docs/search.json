My background includes both computational and experimental biology, and work in fundamental research, clinical research, and industry.\nOutside of work, I enjoy arts (among which playing music and dancing), crafts (particularly woodworking and cooking), and spending time exploring. I care about the environment, human rights, education, and participating in like-minded communities."
